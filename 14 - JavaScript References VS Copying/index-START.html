    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = "Lex";

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = "Sanja";
    console.log(team4);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const team5 = Array.from(players);


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.age = 99;
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 , age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // const cap3 = {...person};
    //doesn't work yet!

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const sanja = {
      name: 'Sanja',
      age: 33,
      social: {
        instagram: '@sanjwich',
        facebook: 'Sa Nja'
      }
    }

    console.clear();
    console.log(sanja);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, sanja)
    //this makes a copy, rather than a reference, and only for the main object!!!
    //It doesn't get teh 2nd object; then you would need the cloneDeep function

    //or use the "poor man's deepClone"
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(sanja));
    //but messy/runs poorly
